        <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
        <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals of
            sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose
            behavior detracts from this purpose
            is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or
            standing.</p>

                associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that
                meets these minimum requirements must
                advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                leagues, districts or associations
